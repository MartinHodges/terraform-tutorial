# Terraform Tutorial

This project is a starter for a tutorial on Terraform using the 
Mastercard REST API provider with a Binary Lane service.

This project shell allows you to add VPCs and VPSs using Terraform 
modules. You will need a Binary Lane account to do this as the tfvars file
requires you to provide an API key.

For further information, leave a message for the repository owner.

After installing terraform, you can carry out the following:

    terraform init
    terraform plam
    terraform apply

Note that to access your servers you should set up your Binary Lane
account with your SSH keys provisioned to all servers you create.
